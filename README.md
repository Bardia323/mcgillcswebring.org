<h1>McGill CS Webring</h1>
Web rings were an old fashioned form of search engine optimization to link together websites of a similar theme. This is a throwback to that! This is a site to aggregate websites made by students at McGill. If you're a computer science student at McGill University, fork the repository, edit ./js.sites and add your name, website, and year. This project took heavy inspiration from UWaterloo's [se-webring](https://github.com/simcard0000/se-webring/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#whats-a-webring) and [ece.engineering](https://github.com/roozbehali/ece_webring)
