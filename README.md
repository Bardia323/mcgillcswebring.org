# McGill CS Webring

Web rings were an old fashioned form of search engine optimization to link together websites of a similar theme. This is a throwback to that! This site aims to aggregate websites made by students at McGill. If you're a computer science student at McGill University, here's how you can add your website to the webring:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Edit `./js/sites.js` (assuming this is a JavaScript file containing the list of sites in the webring).
3. Add your details in the format: `{ name: "Your Name", url: "Your Website URL", year: "Your Year of Graduation" }`.
4. Submit a pull request with your changes.

This project took heavy inspiration from UWaterloo's [se-webring](https://github.com/simcard0000/se-webring/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#whats-a-webring) and [ece.engineering](https://github.com/roozbehali/ece_webring).
