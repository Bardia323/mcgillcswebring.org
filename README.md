# üíç [McGill CS Webring](http://mcgillcswebring.pages.dev/)

Web rings were an old fashioned form of search engine optimization to link together websites of a similar theme. This is a throwback to that! This site aims to aggregate websites made by students at McGill. If you're a computer science student at McGill University, here's how you can add your website to the webring:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Edit `./js/sites.js`
3. Add your details in the format: `{ name: "Your Name", year: "Your Year of Graduation", website: "Your Website URL"}`.
4. Submit a pull request with your changes.
5. ##It's strongly recommended to add a link to this site on your site, but you dont have to.

This project took heavy inspiration from UWaterloo's [se-webring](https://github.com/simcard0000/se-webring/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#whats-a-webring) and [ece.engineering](https://github.com/roozbehali/ece_webring).

## How to Fork and Edit

- **Forking**: Click on the 'Fork' button at the top right corner of the repository page. This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.
- **Editing `./js/sites.js`**: Navigate to the `js` directory in your forked repository, find the `sites.js` file, and click on the edit icon (pencil). Add your details in the specified format.
- **Submitting a Pull Request**: After committing your changes, head to the 'Pull requests' tab in the original repository and click 'New pull request'. Make sure to select your fork as the 'compare' branch and describe the changes you made.
